# Global Warming DataArt - Mixing Data, Code, and Art

## Project Goal

Presnet global warming data in a creative way.

## Data-Set

The data set was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) (License

## Sketchs

### Sketch 1 - random

This sketch is based on the Global Temperatures dataset; the dataset includes the average land temperatures on earth from 1750 until 2015.

In this sketch, for each shape (`rect`), the size and the color is defined by the `LandAverageTemperature` for that day, the location of each shape is entirely random.

### Sketch 2 - Getting Bigger

This sketch is based on the Global Land Temperatures By Major City dataset; the dataset includes the average land temperatures on major cities from 1750 until 2015, including their location.

The idea in this sketch is to present the change in the land temperature per major city. The size and the color of the shapes are set by the local average temperature per date, the location of the shapes is stable and unchanging.

The original data set went throw few sorting and cleaning at this [jupyter notebook](warming-jupyter/temp-by-city.ipynb)
