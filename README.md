## Project Goal

## Sketchs

### Sketch 1 - random

This sketch is based on the Global Temperatures dataset; the dataset includes the average land temperatures on earth from 1750 until 2015.

In this sketch, for each shape (`rect`), the size and the color is defined by the `LandAverageTemperature` for that day, the location of each shape is entirely random.
